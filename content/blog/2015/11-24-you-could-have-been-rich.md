Title: you could have been rich
Date: 2015-11-24

Like any kid, I dreamed of what I'd do if I were wealthy. I'd travel the world,
live a pampered life, and possess any luxury imaginable. I'd be a grand
philanthropist, fund research, and better the human condition. I'd be happy
because I would have everything I wanted, and because I'd know I was helping
others to have everything they needed.

I imagine we've all had similar fantasies, in which we've reached a certain
level of fulfillment in our lives and look to charity as a way to reach yet
another. And we've all faced the same realization: our charitable contributions
would be a pittance compared to affluent donors'. How can we possibly make a
difference without huge sums of money?

The answer is that once we stop seeing money as the only way to effect change,
we can pave the highway to happiness. I realized that it was not the act of
donating that makes me happy, but the more holistic idea of helping people in
general. I realized that it was possible to achieve happiness without the
middleman of money.

But how can someone without money have as much of an impact as someone with?
Luckily, modern technology enables us to have a huge impact without huge
wallets. We can donate something just as powerful as money: passion.

Whether that passion take the form of writing helpful comments online or
developing open-source software, our time is more valuable than it may seem.
Find what you do well, and do some of it for free - that is a contribution to
society worth far more than money. Don't let anyone shame you for not cashing
in on your free work. "You could have been rich" is the ultimate compliment.
