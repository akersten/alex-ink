Title: committing to committing
Date: 2016-01-04

Recently, I noticed that I achieved my longest consecutive streak of commits so
far on my GitHub profile.

It's a silly bit of bar filling, but I think I'll try to keep the streak going
as long as possilbe this year. It's a form of [code every
day](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/), even if some commits aren't
useful code. Here's to 2016!
